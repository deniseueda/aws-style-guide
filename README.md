# AWS Style Guide
One thing that bothers me when I go work in other job is the different way of organizing and naming capabilities of AWS services that each company has. To try to join ideas and, inspired by the [ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide), I decided to create a common sense of organization to AWS resources.

If you just started a AWS account now for your company then you can use this guide as a start line. If you have requirements that is unusual then you can fork this guide and keep updating to let people know how you solved your problems.

I do not know everything, but I hope the community can help me sharing their ideas in this repository.

# Spread the Word

A community-driven style guide is of little use to a community that doesn't know
about its existence. Tweet about the guide, share it with your friends and
colleagues. Every comment, suggestion or opinion we get makes the guide just a
little bit better. And we want to have the best possible guide, don't we?

Cheers,<br/>
